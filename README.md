# reMarkable to Xournal++ converter

Convert a PDF file annotated with reMarkable and extracted as a .zip to a .pdf/.xopp pair. There is no conversion back from .xopp to reMarkable. Notepads are not (yet) supported. 

A lot of the code has been copied from rM2svg.py in https://github.com/lschwetlick/maxio
